# Airbnb_listings
I explored Airbnb listings in this mini-project using Python | Pandas | Matplotlib. My finding are based on the information about neighbourhoods in Paris,  places that accommodate and their prices during 2008-2021.
## Project: Analyzing Airbnb Listings in Paris (2008-2021)
In this project, I explored Airbnb listings in Paris using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to uncover insights into pricing trends, neighborhood affordability, and new host activity over time. The goal was to analyze how accommodation prices varied across neighborhoods and track market trends from 2008 to 2021.
## Business Needs & Objectives:
ðŸ“Œ Understand Pricing Trends â€“ Identify the most and least expensive neighborhoods and accommodations.
ðŸ“Œ Host Growth Analysis â€“ Track the number of new hosts joining Airbnb over time.
ðŸ“Œ Neighborhood Insights â€“ Compare average prices across different districts.
ðŸ“Œ Data Quality Assessment â€“ Ensure the dataset is clean and structured for analysis.
## Key Steps & Tasks:
âœ” Data Cleaning & Preparation:
Loaded Airbnb listings into Google Colab and fixed mixed column types.
Converted date columns to datetime format for accurate time-based analysis.
Filtered the dataset to Paris-only listings, keeping key attributes like neighborhood, price, accommodates, and host_since.
âœ” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Checked for missing values and calculated min, max, and average prices.
Created summary tables to compare average prices across neighborhoods and accommodation sizes.
âœ” Data Visualization & Insights:
Bar Charts: Compared average prices by neighborhood and number of guests accommodated.
Time Series Analysis: Created line charts to track Airbnb price trends and new host growth over the years.
Dual-Axis Chart: Visualized new host count vs. average price trends on a single graph.
## Outcome:
This analysis provided actionable insights into pricing patterns and host activity in Paris, helping potential investors, travelers, and Airbnb hosts understand market trends over time:
â—‰ In 2015 with average price of â‚¬98.32 (one of the lowest in the range) Airbnb brought 365 new hosts
â—‰ In 2021 we see a significant decrese of new hosts (probably due to coronavirus) 
â—‰ During 2013-2018 the lowest prices brought more new hosts, which increased the number of positive reviews
â—‰ The Elysee appeared to be the most expensive neighbourhood, the Menilmontant - the cheapest.
â—‰ The Elysee can accommodate up to 16 people at once.
â—‰ The highest average accomodation price is â‚¬971.
â—‰ Airbnb got 366 new hosts in 2016.
